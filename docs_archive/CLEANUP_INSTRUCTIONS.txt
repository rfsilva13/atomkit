CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================

The tests/test_configuration.py file is corrupted. 

TO FIX:

1. Delete the corrupted file:
   rm tests/test_configuration.py

2. Copy the clean version:
   cp tests_clean_version.py tests/test_configuration.py

3. Clean up the temp file:
   rm tests_clean_version.py

4. Test it works:
   micromamba run -n atomkit pytest tests/test_configuration.py -v

WHAT'S IN THE CLEAN FILE:
- 5 test classes with ~20 simple tests total
- Tests: parsing, electron counting, validation, conversion, real-world cases
- Clean, minimal, easy to understand
- Uses correct API: l_quantum, occupation, total_electrons()
