# AtomKit

AtomKit is a Python library designed for parsing, manipulating, and analyzing atomic structure and spectral data from various atomic physics codes.

## Current Capabilities

- **Shell Representation:** Defines a `Shell` class to represent atomic electron shells, subshells, and relativistic sub-subshells, including properties like quantum numbers (n, l, j), occupation, spectroscopic notation, and maximum occupancy.
- **Configuration Management:** Provides a `Configuration` class to manage collections of `Shell` objects, representing the electron configuration of an atom or ion. Supports:
  - Creation from lists of `Shell` objects.
  - Parsing from standard string notation (e.g., `1s2.2s2.2p6`, `2p-1.2p+3`).
  - Parsing from compact notation (e.g., `1*2.2*8`).
  - Creation from element identifiers (using `mendeleev`).
  - Calculation of total electrons and ion stage.
  - Comparison between configurations.
  - Splitting into core/valence configurations.
  - Generation of hole and excited configurations.
  - Calculation of X-ray notation labels for hole states.
- **FAC Data Reading:** Includes readers (`read_fac`, `read_fac_transitions`) to parse energy level (`.lev.asc`) and transition (`.tr.asc`) files generated by the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). Features include:
  - Automatic handling of multi-block FAC files.
  - Extraction of header information (Z, Nele, MULTIP).
  - Conversion of level energies and transition wavelengths/energies to user-specified units (eV, cm⁻¹, Ry, nm, Å, etc.).
  - Calculation of line strength (S) and multipole type.
  - Flexible options for column selection and renaming.
  - Adjustable logging verbosity (0: Warnings/Errors, 1: Info (Default), 2: Debug).
  - Output as pandas DataFrames with concise column names by default.
  - Optional inclusion of `method` and `new_config` (Configuration object) columns.
